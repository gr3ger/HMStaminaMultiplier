## HMStaminaMultiplier

A MelonLoader mod for Harvest Moon: The Winds of Anthos to adjust stamina consumption in the game.

### Installation
1. Install [MelonLoader](https://github.com/LavaGang/MelonLoader) (0.7.1 was used when developing the mod)
2. Download the DLL from [Releases](https://github.com/gr3ger/HMStaminaMultiplier/releases/latest) and drop it in the `Mods` folder
3. Start the game
4. Now a configuration file has been created (`UserData/MelonPreferences.cfg`) where you can configure what multiplier you want to use. By default it multiplies the original damage by 0.5, which effectively gives you 2x stamina.

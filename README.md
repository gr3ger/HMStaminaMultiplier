## HMStaminaMultiplier

A MelonLoader mod for Harvest Moon: The Winds of Anthos to adjust stamina consumption in the game.
By default it multiplies the original stamina consumption by 0.5, which effectively means that your stamina will drain half as fast.

### Installation
1. Download [MelonLoader](https://github.com/LavaGang/MelonLoader) and use the installer to add it to your game (version 0.7.1 was used when developing the mod)
2. Download the DLL from [Releases](https://github.com/gr3ger/HMStaminaMultiplier/releases/latest) and drop it in the `Mods` folder, the folder is in the same location as the game *.exe
3. Start the game
4. Now a configuration file has been created (`UserData/MelonPreferences.cfg`) where you can configure what multiplier you want to use at any time, you don't need to restart the game. This would usually mean a value between 0.0 and 1.0
